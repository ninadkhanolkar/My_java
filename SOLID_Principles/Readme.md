	 	OO principles
	 	--------------
	 	
	 		S.O.L.I.D principles
	 		
	 		S - Single responsibility principle
	 		O - Open closed principle :- open for extension but closed for modification
	 		L - Liskov substitution principle :- derived classes must be substitutable for the base class. eg. square, rectangle
	 		I - Interface segregation principle :- clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. smaller interfaces
	 		D - Dependency Inversion principle :- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions
